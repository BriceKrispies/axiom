# Browser Debug Overlay & Command Console

A developer debug overlay for the live browser/WASM engine surface, plus a tiny
in-overlay command console. The overlay itself is the **`axiom-debug-overlay`
engine module**; this harness app (`apps/axiom-browser-dev-harness`) is a thin
host that mounts it over a bare canvas and feeds it real diagnostics.

## Keyboard contract

All four shortcuts use the **physical** key (`KeyboardEvent.code == "Backquote"`):

| Shortcut            | Action                                  |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `` ` ``             | Toggle the overlay (show / hide)        |
| `Shift` + `` ` ``   | Cycle density: compact → normal → verbose → compact |
| `Ctrl` + `` ` ``    | Pin / unpin the overlay                 |
| `Alt` + `` ` ``     | Open the overlay and focus the console  |

Rules: Backquote is **not** stolen while a normal `input`/`textarea`/
`contenteditable` is focused — except the overlay's own console; `preventDefault`
fires only for handled chords; a held meta key (Cmd/Win) is left to the OS; a
pinned overlay ignores the toggle's hide (unpin, or run `overlay.hide`).

## Moving the window

Drag the **title bar** (the green header) to move the overlay anywhere on screen
— it clamps to stay within the viewport. The position + drag math is the module's
pure, branchless `DragState`; the wasm arm wires it to header pointer events
(mouse, touch, and pen, via Pointer Capture).

## Console commands

`>` prompt at the bottom; Enter submits, Escape blurs (overlay stays open),
ArrowUp/ArrowDown walk the in-memory history. Routed through a **real registry**
— no `eval`/`Function`/dynamic import; unknown commands return a clean error;
empty input is ignored.

`help`, `clear`, `overlay.compact`, `overlay.normal`, `overlay.verbose`,
`overlay.pin`, `overlay.unpin`, `overlay.hide`, `diagnostics.snapshot`,
`backend.report`, `replay.mark` (stub), `perf.mark` (stub).

## Density modes

- **compact** — title, fps, frame time, renderer backend, fallback count.
- **normal** — the core diagnostics read-out plus the command-history count.
- **verbose** — everything in normal, plus the raw backend selection, the
  overlay's own debug state, and a command-history preview.

## Architecture & boundaries

The overlay lives in `modules/axiom-debug-overlay`, the **fourth sanctioned
platform-facing module** (Module Law #9, alongside `windowing`/`gpu-backend`/
`canvas2d-backend`). It is held to the full engine spine discipline:

- **One facade** (`DebugOverlayApi`) — Module Law #8. Diagnostics cross it as
  primitives (booleans, integers, `&str`, tuples); **no naked float** crosses
  (timing is integer-encoded `fps_milli` / `frame_time_micros`, so the
  `engine_no_unitless_float_public_api` lint is satisfied).
- **Branchless core** — the whole state machine (density, command
  registry/dispatch, console history, keyboard classification, the diagnostics
  model) is branchless (`toggle` is `!visible | pinned`, density cycling and
  shortcut dispatch are `const` tables indexed by an enum discriminant, …).
- **100% covered** — every region/line/function of the pure core is exercised by
  native tests.
- **DOM in the wasm arm only** — `web_sys` lives in `dom_binding.rs`
  (`#[cfg(target_arch = "wasm32")]`), behind the native-clean facade, exactly
  like windowing's live presentation arm. It never enters the native build, the
  coverage gate, or the branchless lint.

The deterministic engine spine (kernel/runtime/math, the layers) still knows
nothing about the DOM, keyboard, CSS, or command text.

## Diagnostics are real, fed by the host — never engine state

The overlay only ever *reads* diagnostics pushed in through the facade; it is a
read-out, never a source of engine state. This harness feeds **real** values —
there is no stub provider:

- **fps / frame time** — measured from `requestAnimationFrame` deltas.
- **frame index** — the RAF frame counter.
- **visibility** — `document`'s hidden flag.
- **renderer backend / fallback** — a real `navigator.gpu` capability probe,
  reporting the engine's actual WebGPU→WebGL2 fallback choice.
- Fields the harness can't observe without running the engine (sim ticks, GPU
  submissions, worker messages) are honest zeroes; absent subsystems
  (storage/audio/network) are honest `none`.

A different host (a real engine app) implements the same `set_frame` /
`set_backends` / `set_counters` / … seam with its own real engine facts — the
overlay code does not change.

## Browser verification

No automated browser/e2e harness is wired into the native suite yet, so
DOM-level verification is by hand. Build and serve, then drive it with the
Playwright controller:

```sh
make harness-build      # cargo build --target wasm32 + wasm-bindgen into web/pkg
make harness            # serve apps/axiom-browser-dev-harness/web (use HARNESS_PORT to avoid clashes)

uv run scripts/playwright_controller.py goto http://localhost:8000/
uv run scripts/playwright_controller.py eval "(() => { window.dispatchEvent(new KeyboardEvent('keydown',{code:'Backquote',bubbles:true})); const e=document.getElementById('axiom-debug-overlay'); return !!e && !e.hasAttribute('hidden'); })()"
uv run scripts/playwright_controller.py screenshot overlay
```

The same overlay also rides on top of the other gallery demos (the shared shell
loads this wasm and mounts it), where the measured fps reflects that demo's real
frame rate.
