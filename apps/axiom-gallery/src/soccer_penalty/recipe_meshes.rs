//! Reusable **mesh recipe macros** for the soccer diorama's geometry.
//!
//! These replace the deleted hand-authored `penalty_meshes` [`MeshData`]
//! generators (`unit_cube` / `unit_sphere` / `unit_capsule`): every shape the
//! diorama draws is now a small [`RecipeGraph`] of mesh operators
//! (`axiom-proc-mesh`), baked by the render bridge and registered through the
//! ordinary `RunningApp::add_mesh_data` hook. The app builds no vertices of its
//! own.
//!
//! Each returns a **unit-extent** mesh (fits a 1×1×1 box centred at the origin —
//! except the capsule, whose XZ footprint is 0.8), so the render bridge scales it
//! per object exactly as it scaled the old hand meshes. The shape → mesh mapping
//! in `penalty_render_meshed::select_mesh` is unchanged: boxes for structure and
//! torsos, the rounded ball for the ball and head/hand joints, the capsule for
//! limbs.
//!
//! Recipe ids are allocated in the `700..` band.
//!
//! [`MeshData`]: axiom::prelude::MeshData
