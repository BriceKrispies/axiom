# OVERWATCH — engine contract

**Every agent must read this before writing code. It is the only coordination mechanism.**

Target: a browser FPS whose *visual and tactile quality* stands next to a modern
Call of Duty. WebGL2 + Three.js r180, no external art assets — all textures,
meshes, animation and audio are generated procedurally at load time.

## Hard rules

1. **You own your directory. Never edit files outside it.** Another agent owns
   every other directory and your edit will be clobbered or will break them.
2. **Never import another subsystem's module.** Get it at runtime:
   `const fx = ctx.get('fx')`. This is what makes parallel work safe.
3. **No new npm dependencies.** `three` only. No CDN fetches, no external
   images/HDRIs/models/audio files — the game must run fully offline.
4. **No `Math.random()` in gameplay or visuals.** Use `ctx.rng` (see
   `src/core/rng.js`) or a `ctx.rng.fork()` you keep. Capture reproducibility
   depends on it.
5. **Allocate nothing per-frame.** Preallocate vectors, matrices and arrays in
   `init()` and reuse. A `new THREE.Vector3()` inside `update()` is a bug.
6. **Dispose what you create.** Geometries, materials, textures and render
   targets get freed in `dispose()`.
7. `npm run build` must pass and `node tools/capture.mjs` must produce a frame
   after your change. If you break the boot, nobody else can work.

## Subsystem interface

```js
export class MySystem {
  static id = 'mysystem';       // unique; how others reach you
  static deps = ['render'];     // ids that must init before you

  prepare(ctx) {}               // optional, BEFORE any init(); see below
  async init(ctx) {}            // build resources; may await
  *stream(ctx) {}               // optional, deferred construction; see below
  fixedUpdate(h, ctx) {}        // optional, 120 Hz, deterministic gameplay
  update(dt, ctx) {}            // optional, once per frame
  lateUpdate(dt, ctx) {}        // optional, after all update()
  resize(w, h, ctx) {}          // optional
  dispose() {}                  // optional
}
```

`ctx` provides: `scene`, `camera`, `viewScene`, `viewCamera`, `canvas`,
`config`, `events`, `input`, `time`, `rng`, `bakery`, `get(id)`, `peek(id)`,
`has(id)`.

### `prepare(ctx)` — claim your seed, start your pure work

`Engine.init()` runs `prepare()` on **every** subsystem, in dependency order,
before it runs **any** `init()`. Exactly two things belong in it:

1. **Fork your RNG.** `this.rng = ctx.rng.fork()`. Every subsystem's seed is
   decided purely by how many forks of the root stream preceded it, so a fork
   taken anywhere else — inside a constructor, lazily on first use — makes your
   seed depend on *when* that code ran. `Viewmodel` used to do exactly that and
   sat at position 6 only because `weapons` happened to init before `fx`; every
   subsystem seeded after it was silently downstream of when a viewmodel got
   built. Keep every root fork here and that whole class of bug is gone.
   `node tools/rngprobe.mjs --trace` prints the fork order.

2. **Queue pure precomputation on `ctx.bakery`.** A bake is a function from a
   seed to typed arrays: no THREE, no GPU, no DOM, no shared state. Started
   here it runs on a worker while every subsystem builds its object graphs on
   the main thread; started inside your own `init()` there is nothing left to
   overlap it with. Keep the promise, `await` it in `init()`.

`prepare()` must not touch the GPU, the scene graph, or another subsystem —
none of them have init'd yet. It should also be idempotent (`if (this.rng)
return;`) and called from the top of your own `init()`, so a standalone preview
page that drives your subsystem without an Engine still works.

The recipes live in `src/bakers.js`; the pool is `src/core/bakery.js`. Measured
with `node tools/bootprofile.mjs`, moving the character and FX texture bakes
into it took ~3.9 s of value-noise evaluation off the boot critical path.

### `stream(ctx)` — the half that does not block the first frame

`init()` builds what frame 1 genuinely needs. Everything else goes in a
generator that the engine drains a few milliseconds per frame, **with the game
already on screen**:

```js
*stream(ctx) {
  this._buildWeapon('rifle'); yield 'rifle';   // a yield is a safe stopping point
  this._buildWeapon('smg');   yield 'smg';
}
```

Put work here when the player cannot tell it is missing on frame 1: a weapon
they are not holding, a navigation grid for enemies that have not engaged, a
shader they have not drawn yet. Keep work in `init()` when the frame would be
wrong without it — collision, the level they are standing in, the HUD.

The budget is checked **between** chunks, not inside them, so a generator that
yields once per 200 ms hitches for 200 ms whatever the budget is.
`stats.worstChunkMs` names the offender.

Two rules that make this safe rather than merely fast:

- **Tolerate the gap.** The frames before your chunk lands must render
  correctly without it. `Viewmodel.update()` returns early with no active
  weapon; `AiSystem.update()` has always carried a retry path for a missing
  grid. If a subsystem also retries in `update()`, gate that retry so it cannot
  race `stream()` and do the work twice.
- **Capture drains it.** `?capture=1` runs every generator to completion before
  raising `__READY__` (`Engine.drainStream()`), because a screenshot of a
  half-streamed world is not a regression — it is a different picture, and the
  pixel gate cannot tell them apart.

`window.__READY__` now means *the first playable frame*; `window.__LOADED__`
means streaming and pre-warm have finished behind it. A tool measuring steady
state wants the second.

- `scene` / `camera` — the world. `viewScene` / `viewCamera` — the first-person
  weapon, drawn separately so it can never clip through walls.
- `time` — `{ elapsed, raw, dt, fixed, alpha, scale, frame }`. Use `alpha` to
  interpolate rendered transforms between physics steps.
- `config.q` — the active quality preset (see `src/core/config.js`). Respect
  `q.taa`, `q.gtao`, `q.ssr`, `q.volumetrics`, `q.shadowMapSize`,
  `q.particleBudget`, `q.decalBudget`. Never exceed a budget.

## Cross-subsystem events

Emit and listen via `ctx.events`. Payloads are plain objects. The canonical set:

| event | payload | emitted by |
|---|---|---|
| `weapon:fire` | `{ weapon, origin: Vector3, dir: Vector3, seed }` | weapons |
| `weapon:reload` | `{ weapon, phase: 'start'\|'magout'\|'magin'\|'end' }` | weapons |
| `weapon:shell` | `{ position, velocity }` | weapons |
| `bullet:impact` | `{ point, normal, surface, incident, damage }` | physics |
| `bullet:tracer` | `{ from, to, speed }` | weapons |
| `damage:dealt` | `{ target, amount, headshot, killed, point }` | ai / physics |
| ↳ | means *damage dealt **to** `target`*. `target` is the local player when an enemy round connects (`'player'`, the player system, or anything with `isPlayer === true`) — filter it out before drawing a hitmarker. Damage is applied by the target's own listener, never by the emitter as well. | |
| `damage:taken` | `{ amount, from: Vector3, health }` | player |
| `actor:death` | `{ actor, point, impulse }` | ai |
| `player:land` | `{ velocity, surface }` | player |
| `player:footstep` | `{ position, surface, running }` | player |
| `player:state` | `{ stance, sprinting, sliding, ads }` | player |
| `explosion` | `{ position, radius, damage }` | any |
| `resize` | `{ width, height }` | engine |

If you need an event that is not listed, add a row here in the same commit.

## Surface types

Shared vocabulary for impact FX, decals, audio and footsteps. Physics tags every
collider with one of: `concrete`, `metal`, `wood`, `dirt`, `sand`, `glass`,
`water`, `foliage`, `fabric`, `flesh`, `rubber`, `plaster`.

## Render integration

`render` exposes these to other subsystems:

```js
const r = ctx.get('render');
r.renderer            // THREE.WebGLRenderer — do not change its state outside a frame
r.registerPass(pass)  // insert a custom post pass
r.addLight(light)     // register a punctual light so it participates in culling/budgets
r.requestEnvMap()     // PMREM env map currently in use
r.screenSize          // { width, height } of the internal render target
r.depthTexture        // linear depth, for soft particles / SSR
r.velocityTexture     // motion vectors, for TAA / motion blur
```

Anything drawn into `viewScene` is composited after the world with a cleared
depth buffer.

Per-object opt-outs, honoured every frame by `render._collect`:

```js
mesh.userData.owNoPrepass = true  // keep out of the depth/normal/velocity prepass
mesh.userData.owNoShadow  = true  // do not cast into the CSM cascades
```

`owNoShadow` is the ONLY shadow-caster switch: the cascades draw with
`scene.overrideMaterial` and never consult `mesh.castShadow`. `src/ai` relies on
this for its off-screen actor LOD.

### The point-light count is a shader permutation key

`r.addLight()` puts a light under distance culling, and the cull sets
`light.visible = false` once the fade reaches zero. Three bakes the number of
**visible** point lights into every material's program cache key, so one lamp
crossing its radius recompiles every lit material in the scene — measured at
+33 to +36 programs and 640-900 ms on that single frame, five times in 900
frames. Anything that registers distance-culled point lights must keep the
visible count constant. Two ways, both pixel-exact:

- drive `intensity` to 0 and leave `visible` true (what `src/fx/lights.js` does), or
- park zero-intensity "ballast" lights and top the count up to a fixed slot
  budget every `lateUpdate` (what `src/world` does for its 17 practicals — see
  `_stabiliseLightCount`, which mirrors the renderer's own fade test because the
  cull runs *after* `lateUpdate`).

A light whose colour × intensity is exactly 0 adds a float `0.0` to the
irradiance accumulator, so extra lit slots cannot move a pixel.

### Pre-warm

`src/core/prewarm.js` runs before the first frame and calls
`prewarmMaterials(ctx)` on every subsystem that implements it (`render`,
`world`, `ai`). The contract: **build and compile every material the subsystem
can produce, without spawning gameplay objects, drawing a gameplay frame, or
touching the clock/RNG.** `renderer.compileAsync(scene, camera)` alone only
reaches the forward lit variant — not the CSM depth pass, the MRT prepass, or
the post chain. Two traps:

- A render target must be bound while compiling. `outputColorSpace` and
  `toneMapping` are part of the cache key and are read off the *currently bound*
  target, so compiling with the canvas bound warms the wrong variant.
- `fx` is excluded and self-warms on frame 2: its key depends on the visible
  light count, which is only settled inside the first rendered frame.

## Quality bar

Every visual subsystem is reviewed by an adversarial critic against real CoD
frames. Non-negotiables:

- **No flat/untextured surfaces.** Every material needs albedo variation, a
  normal map, roughness variation, and a detail layer visible at 0.5 m.
- **No uniform lighting.** Contact shadows, bounce, ambient occlusion, and a
  clear key/fill/rim separation.
- **Physically plausible values.** Albedo in 0.02–0.9, metals are 0 or 1,
  real-world light intensities, exposure-driven not multiplier-driven.
- **Nothing perfectly straight, clean, or repeated.** Edge wear, grime in
  crevices, subtle warp, varied instance rotation/scale.
- **Every action has weight.** Recoil, camera shake, screen-space impulse,
  audio transient, and a visual FX on every impact.
