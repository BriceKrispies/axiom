/*
 * The neutral value vocabulary every authoring projection traffics in (SPEC-00
 * §0.2 / §5). These are pure data shapes — opaque numeric handles and small
 * records — with no behavior: the nouns the `Sim`/`World`/`Input` projections
 * hand back. They are intentionally structural (a bare `number` for every
 * handle) so the wasm `NativeBridge` can carry them across the boundary as
 * plain values and a replay can re-bind them (SPEC-00 §9).
 *
 * `Result<T> = T | undefined` is the single optional shape: a query miss, an
 * absent component, or a read on a dead handle is the empty value, never a
 * throw (SPEC-02 §5, whose contract notation is `T | null`). The TS projection
 * uses `undefined` — the TS-native optional and the form the SDK's lint law
 * mandates (`unicorn/no-null` bans the `null` literal, exactly as the Rust
 * spine is branchless). The empty value lives only in this type position and is
 * produced solely by the bridge implementation; the spine never writes an empty
 * literal (`eslint/no-undefined`), it forwards what the bridge returns.
